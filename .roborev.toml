This is an R package that converts Shiny apps into MCP (Model Context Protocol) Apps.
Uses R6 for McpApp/ResourceRegistry, htmltools for UI components, and a self-contained ES5 JS bridge.

Quality gates that must pass:
- air format (R/ and tests/testthat/) - tidyverse-style formatting
- devtools::check() - R CMD check with no errors/warnings

Conventions:
- Use cli::cli_abort() for errors, cli::cli_warn() for warnings
- snake_case naming, tidyverse style throughout
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Tests use testthat 3e
- JS bridge must remain ES5-compatible (no const/let/arrow functions/Set)
- Never commit directly to main; feature branches + PRs only
